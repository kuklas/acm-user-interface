"What is working?"
"What is not working?"
"very specific prompting. had to avoid the word ""element"" when dealing with a basic paragraph... vs the content component"
"Getting Cursor to add right-hand buttons to the Masthead. Maybe it had trouble reading the example?"
"i tried several times to install the chatbot package and it kept applying cusotm styling, changing the container to a modal and removing all appropraite UI atyling. it had to rerun it twice to get to a place that wasnt horrible"
"Quickly generated new base app with drawer - code compiled and ran, but inline styles were implemented and would not run correctly"
"how to deploy and share a prototype (host it)"
"many in the room got stuck when the code blew up.  Often, telling cursor to fix errors will help the user get past these errors."
"more detailed instructions on installing node and git needed for non-developers.  Git - explain steps for setting up authentication. How to test that they are installed "
"Deploying for preview is kinda difficult. Vercel gave me trouble. Surge too."
"can we load cursor with the seed app from this workshop"
"vague prompts do not really work. I had to be very specific for the application to be consistent and applied on the first ask"
"with a dev base, up and running quickly. able to generate a basic charting and inventory display with minimal effort."
"After first prompt, received multiple errors like export 'TextContent' (imported as 'TextContent') was not found in '@patternfly/react-core'  no clue how to fix"
"Issues with color applied to icons. Bot ended up hardcoding hex values"
"Had to click multiple things within the chat ""open"", ""accept"", but it wasn't clear to me that it was waiting on my input"
"During step 2: Set context. When I clicked the ""Follow this link to get to the MCP settings in Cursor"" link the popover would disappear before I could click ""open in cursor"". I had to get Erin to help me.","https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=context7&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5jb250ZXh0Ny5jb20vbWNwIn0%3D"
"UI did not build on first prompt due to generation of PF components that don't exist"
"Able to add additional rules when prompted to avoid className={styles.blahblah}, etc. in future"
"Jan told me to tell cursor to fix this and it did"
"Able to create a basic page framework"
"Correctly identified surge as a deployment option but commands didn't work"
"App it generated was not keyboard-accessible - probably other issues"
"when it first generated the page, there was a dropdown that was stuck open at the topleft corner of screen. i told cursor about it and it fixed it properly"
"Added inline styles that were not formatted in an executable way. Asked it to switch and it created CSS module files, but used className={styles.blahblahBlah} instead of actual classNames. This did not compile. It was also using CSS modules, which this app doesn't support."
"Installed react-charts & victory but build broke until I manually changed import paths to add /victory"
"i told cursor to fix my error codes and provided the codes back. it was able to fix it quickly"
"Got terminal error: ""Card: Clickable-only cards must have either the selectableActions.selectableActionAriaLabel or selectableActions.selectableActionAriaLabelledby prop passed in order to provide an accessible name to the clickable element. Error Component Stack"". Was not able to handle fixing it - hallucinated wrong solution."
"Spacing was very off - asking it to correct that was very difficult. Would be faster to fix by hand."
"First pass utilized a lot of inline styles and utility layout classes"
"Once ChatBot components used, it wasn't setting up the layout properly. I pasted in a demo and it got further. Could maybe benefit from provided code examples, but may be easier to just copy and paste a demo tbh. Was really slow."
"Asked it to add a PatternFly ChatBot and it made its own not using the extension. It did correctly add the CSS and install the package."
"Does this spark any new ideas?"
"What sort of manual intervention was required to correct the AI?"
"Chart import paths needed to be manually appended with /victory, prompting did not fix this issue"
"curious to see if this setup can be applied to other editors/ides"
"how can each experiment like we did today add to or help train our PF MCP/rule sets?"
"Possibly running a11y audits (maybe more as a cursory step rather than the only/an in-depth step)"
"had to repeat my request to create a single page. it first created multiple pages/tabs, even though I originally said single page"
"Generated component EmptyStateHeader which does not exist in PF, required correction to use EmptyState with EmptyStateBody"
"Modal body vs dumping content right in"
"had to send screenshots and links from the patternfly site to help it build what I needed"
"Common layouts can be provided by default, for both dashboard and body content."
"Are there tests we could include in the starter app or in other places to check that the produced code was using PF correctly?"
"Can we encompass this starter tool into a one click download and open in cursor to avoid the 'complex set up'"
"Had to ask it to fix 3 linter errors. Took a few minutes but was able to fix on it's own."
"Asked to remove inline styles - needed to correct how it does class names after that and fix errors. It also tried to create CSS modules, which didn't compile - had to ask it to put styles in right file. Then it compiled again. It is sometimes using CSS variables correctly to style components."
"Did not implement a table and used cards for visualization by default, had to prompt for a table"
"how can we reuse what we created and share this with others. maybe a cursor template site with titles to each template. who knows if id find someone elses demo useful later - better to reuse than get a headache from recreating"
"We could improve our hosting guidance to make it easier for people to share their solutions? maybe create a registry of solutions somewhere?"
"If we provide a demo for user testing, maybe folks would be able to use Cursor to edit it if their user flow changed, etc. Cursor seems good at spitting out ""what it wants"" or making very specific, clearly defined changes that are easy for it to verify (linter or build errors, test failures, etc.)"
"Can we create a template for prompts to be as specific as possible so the first attempt can be closer to our desired results?"
"Had to ask again for it use the PF ChatBot extension for it to do it, but the types were wrong - had to ask it to fix them."
"Colors were wrong, it was using invalid CSS tokens. It was guessing what the token name would be based on the docs instead of using tokens defined in the codebase."
"Had to provide examples of successful ChatBot demo to get it to implement it as designed, but even then, it dropped pieces that were important."
"Can PF provide specific guidance for certain data metrics that we can prompt with? e.g. which components to use for certain data"
"Had to keep asking it to not use custom styling and instead rely on native PF styles"
"Had to ask it several times to get chart colors to look better (black bar or text in dark theme)"
"could be valuable to have general strong starter prompts for pf projects but could also see value in products having pre written prompts/rules for their own patterns"
"PatternFly prototype quickstarts for common use cases"
"Struggled to get it to use consistent styling across all cards in a single view. It would randomly change the styling even if my prompt had nothing to do with styling."
"It sometimes helped to provide PF links to specific component examples"
"Ability to select a selection or region on a page that would focus your prompt to only those elements. Sometimes Cursor would randomly change a section I was happy with."
"Can we create a series of styling templates (maybe per product or fidelity) so Canvas uses a consistent style for elements?"
"can we provide type-ahead for prompts that use the PF terms for elements."
"Create cursor templates of validated designs so we can start with an existing design and iterate from there?"
