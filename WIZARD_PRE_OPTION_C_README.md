# Wizard State: Pre-Option C

## Branch: `wizard-pre-option-c`
## Commit: 05f55f82

## Description
This is the stable, working state of the Group Role Assignment Wizard **before** we started experimenting with Option C. This represents the "Major UX improvements across role management and wizards" commit.

## This is the version you asked me to save before experimenting!

When you said "save this and let me experiment", this is the state you wanted preserved.

## Key Features at This Point
- Complete Group Role Assignment Wizard
- Tabs for Users/Groups selection
- Resource selection flow
- Role selection
- Review step
- All major UX improvements implemented

## File Structure
- `src/app/RoleAssignment/GroupRoleAssignmentWizard.tsx` - Main wizard implementation
- Other wizard files for different contexts (Cluster, ClusterSet, Role detail)

## How to Restore
```bash
git checkout wizard-pre-option-c
```

## What Came After This
After this stable state, we experimented with:
- **Option B**: Drawer with carousel examples and inline tables (commit d8385751)
- **Option C**: Substeps with multi-select cluster set filter and granularity radios (commit 25fa5f3d)

## Status
✅ Stable, working implementation  
✅ All features functional  
✅ Ready to use as a base for new experiments
