This implementation features a Group Role Assignment Wizard with an interactive drawer containing 9 carousel examples showing hierarchical resource scopes with visual highlighting.

## Key Features

### Drawer with Carousel Examples

- Examples show hierarchical resource scopes:
  - Cluster sets
  - Clusters
  - Projects
  - Virtual machines

### Inline Table Selection
- Cluster sets table inline (no substep)
- Clusters table inline (no substep)
- Progressive disclosure based on selections
- Tables appear directly in the main wizard flow

### Tree View Visualizations
All 9 examples demonstrate different selection scenarios:
1. Full cluster set access
2. Specific cluster access
3. Project-level access on single cluster
4. Common projects across multiple clusters
5-9. Various combinations of partial access patterns

### Visual Design
- Icons with hierarchical tree lines
