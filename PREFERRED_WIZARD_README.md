- ‚úÖ **Complete UX improvements implemented**
- ‚úÖ **All major features working correctly**
- ‚úÖ **Clean, maintainable codebase**
- ‚úÖ **Ready for production use or further enhancement**

### Design Patterns
- Clean modal wizard interface
- Proper spacing and padding (24px)
- PatternFly component compliance
- Accessible and keyboard navigable

## Files Included
- `src/app/RoleAssignment/GroupRoleAssignmentWizard.tsx` - Main wizard
- `src/app/RoleAssignment/ClusterRoleAssignmentWizard.tsx` - Cluster context
- `src/app/RoleAssignment/ClusterSetRoleAssignmentWizard.tsx` - Cluster set context

- `src/app/RoleAssignment/RoleDetailRoleAssignmentWizard.tsx` - Role detail context

## How to Use
```bash
# Switch to this branch
git checkout wizard-preferred-implementation

# Start development
npm run start
```

## Experimental Alternatives Available
If you need to explore alternative implementations:

1. **Option A**: `wizard-option-a` - Earlier version
2. **Option B**: `option-b-development` - Drawer with carousel examples
3. **Option C**: `option-c-development` - Substeps with granularity options
4. **Pre-Option C**: `wizard-pre-option-c` - Same as preferred (backup)

## Recommendation
**Start from this branch** for any new wizard development or enhancements. The experimental options can be referenced for specific features if needed.

## Status
‚úÖ **PREFERRED** - Use this as the baseline  
‚úÖ Fully tested and working  
‚úÖ Production-ready  
‚úÖ Clean foundation for future work
